- An application that I refactored to use the latest technologies to manage and showcase books.

## Description

- <strong>Motivation:</strong> My motivation for building this application was to create a user-friendly and interactive platform for managing and showcasing books, aimed at using GraphQL instead of a REST API.
- <strong>Purpose:</strong> This project was built to demonstrate my skills in building a full-stack MERN application, providing a seamless and efficient user experience for managing book collections.
- <strong>Problem Solved:</strong> This solves the problem of presenting book collections in a static, less engaging format, by offering a dynamic and interactive experience.
- <strong>Learning Outcomes:</strong> In this project, I learned how to effectively use GraphQL for building interactive UIs, CSS for styling, HTML for structuring web content, and Node.js with Express and Mongoose for backend functionality. This was a refactor to learn how to use GraphQL instead of REST API.
